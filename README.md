The project addresses traffic congestion through an AI-driven traffic light control 
system that dynamically adjusts traffic lights based on real-time vehicle density on 
each road. Using a YOLOv8 model to detect vehicles and an ESP32 microcontroller 
to control the LEDs, this system prioritizes traffic flow on the less congested road. 
The project aims to optimize intersection efficiency, reduce vehicle wait times, 
and improve urban traffic management.
